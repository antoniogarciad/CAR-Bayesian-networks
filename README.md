# CAR-Bayesian-networks
Children activity classification model creation using Bayesian network structures

This R code generates a classification model based on Bayesian networks. 
The configurable parameters are:
dataset: .cvs file containing the instances to analyze and their features
tn: Bayesian network structure, the implemented options are tan_cl (tree-augmented naive Bayes), nb (naive Bayes) and bsej (semi-naive Bayes).

The program obtains the confusion matrix and the precision of the model.
